        <h2><strong>I would describe myself first as a Christian, then a GNU/Linux user, then a drummer and music obsessive.</strong></h2>
        <p>I must admit, I can't maintain a blog. My self motivation is minimal and I can barely keep a private, daily diary going but I would like my domain to display a single static page about me. I'm not a javascript fan but don't even have the desire to build something beautiful in Pico CMS about me. I love good typography and I think this will serve just as well. This site (forked and modified) is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and loads fast;</li>
            <li>Fits on all of your screens;</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all of your awful browsers;</li>
            <li>Accessible to everyone that visits my site;</li>
            <li>Legible with nice line spacing and soft contrast;</li>
            <li>Designed to put a focus on my words with beautiful typography.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Let it breathe even more</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "Look at lines 1 and 2 of some  website you're building. Assuming they're not married, they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash ― pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that... piss off. If your text hits the side of the browser, off forever. Have you ever seen a book like that? Yes? What a book."<br/>

        <p>I made it even better: <code>line-height: 1.6</code></p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit."<br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>I made it even better: <code>background: #f2f2f2</code><br/>Because I don't care about 7 lines of declarations.</p>
        <h2>Yes, this continues to be satirical</h2>
        <p>Like the creator of <a href="http://bettermotherwebsite.com">Better Website</a>, I ♥ what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> did. It's all about the message! But let's face it: would you rather have crap, or some beautifully-aligned shit?</p>
