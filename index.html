        <h2><strong>I would describe myself first as a Christian, then a GNU/Linux user, then a drummer and music obsessive.</strong></h2>
        <p>I must admit, I can't maintain a blog. My self motivation is minimal and I can barely keep a private, daily diary going but I would like my domain to display a single static page about me. I'm not a javascript fan but don't even have the desire to build something beautiful in Pico CMS about me. I love good typography and I think this will serve just as well. This site (forked and modified) is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and loads fast;</li>
            <li>Fits on all of your screens;</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all of your awful browsers;</li>
            <li>Accessible to everyone that visits my site;</li>
            <li>Legible with nice line spacing and soft contrast;</li>
            <li>Designed to put a focus on my words with beautiful typography.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reason for Site Design</h2>
        <p>I don't like dropdown menus. At some point I may end up with a nice footer with horizontal links, or even some in the top right but I don't want dropdown. I don't want image galleries. They increase page load time considerably, they require precise mouse control to use and they heavily mess up device compatibility. This site will always be single column and for the meantime entirely on one page. If I add extra pages they will not be nested. My focus will be on formatting text, not formulating content structures.</p>
