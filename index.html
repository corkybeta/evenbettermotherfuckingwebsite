        <h2><strong>I would describe myself first as a Christian, then a GNU/Linux user, then a drummer and music obsessive.</strong></h2>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm not very young, but I'm not very old. I read too little and I write too infrequently. I speak too quietly and I listen far too much. A perfectionist defeat by his lack of perfection often sits and watches the passage of time. I'm not even a person who can be productive without distraction, only with company of friends. Routines help not because of their regularity but only when they are simple. I think I could do the same menial task for the rest of my life because repetition doesn't bore me, but I'm supposed to aim for something higher. Something with more prestige; and certainly better pay.</p>
        <p>Computers and music are the two things that interest me the most, but my half-hearted attitude tends to leave potential on the drawing board. I can read and understand many programming languages but I wouldn't consider myself a programmer because when left alone my intuition only takes me so far. I understand a lot about electronics but I couldn't manage to solder anything for myself. I can build computers, understand how the components work, connect them to networks and understand how they work, install software and understand how it works, but when thrown outside of the sandbox I don't consider myself to have much to offer. Still, if you'd like to learn anything about IT, ask me. I could talk about it for hours because I tend to be highly informed on any subject, I just can't make much for myself.</p>
        <p>Music is much the same. I play drums, percussion and flute to moderate levels. I listen to more music than anyone I know, looking for complex time signatures, inventive use of rudiments and even looking out for interesting technical ability outside of what I know on a guitar or piano. Progressive rock is my thing but my collection branches out to many other genres and I usually add five or six albums every month. I do quite a bit of sound engineering at church and everything I learn makes me respect the process of making music more. Sadly I'm not a talented musician but if you are, tell me about it. Any artist who can talk about their instrument, their band or their inspiration with competence has earned my respect.</p>

        <p>I must admit, I can't maintain a blog. My self motivation is minimal and I can barely keep a private, daily diary going but I would like my domain to display a single static page about me. I'm not a javascript fan but don't even have the desire to build something beautiful in Pico CMS about me. I love good typography and I think this will serve just as well. This site (forked and modified) is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and loads fast;</li>
            <li>Fits on all of your screens;</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all of your awful browsers;</li>
            <li>Accessible to everyone that visits my site;</li>
            <li>Legible with nice line spacing and soft contrast;</li>
            <li>Designed to put a focus on my words with beautiful typography.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reason for Site Design</h2>
        <p>I don't like dropdown menus. At some point I may end up with a nice footer with horizontal links, or even some in the top right but I don't want dropdown. I don't want image galleries. They increase page load time considerably, they require precise mouse control to use and they heavily mess up device compatibility. This site will always be single column and for the meantime entirely on one page. If I add extra pages they will not be nested. My focus will be on formatting text, not formulating content structures.</p>
